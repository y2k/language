## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Built-in macros SHALL desugar user syntax into core forms

Macro expansion SHALL transform recognized syntactic forms before backend execution or compilation. Binding forms in `let` SHALL preserve pattern structure after normal collection and keyword expansion so backends can distinguish symbol, sequential, and associative binding patterns.

#### Scenario: Desugar collection literals
- **WHEN** the input contains `[1 2]` or `{:a 1}`
- **THEN** vectors become `(list 1 2)` and maps become `(hash-map "a" 1)` after keyword expansion

#### Scenario: Desugar binding and function forms
- **WHEN** the input contains `let`, `fn`, `defn`, or `defn-`
- **THEN** they become `let*`, `fn*`, or `def` plus `fn`

#### Scenario: Preserve sequential let binding patterns
- **WHEN** the input contains `(let [[a b] xs] body)`
- **THEN** macro expansion preserves the binding pattern as a sequential pattern in the resulting `let*` bindings

#### Scenario: Preserve associative let binding patterns
- **WHEN** the input contains `(let [{:name n :age a} user] body)`
- **THEN** macro expansion preserves the binding pattern as an associative pattern in the resulting `let*` bindings

#### Scenario: Preserve short-circuit behavior in logical macros
- **WHEN** the input contains `and` or `or`
- **THEN** expansion uses generated temporaries, `let*`, and `if` so operands are evaluated at most once and only as needed

#### Scenario: Desugar threading macros
- **WHEN** the input contains `->` or `->>`
- **THEN** forms are rewritten by inserting the threaded value as first or last argument respectively

#### Scenario: Desugar interop shorthand
- **WHEN** the input contains `(.method obj args...)` or `(Class. args...)`
- **THEN** it becomes `(. obj method args...)` or `(new Class args...)`
